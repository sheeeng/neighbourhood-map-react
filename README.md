# Neighborhood Map React

Create react app for the last project of the Udacity Front End Developer course.

Created using Google Maps API that shows the best eating places in Oslo, Norway.

Foursquare API was used to obtain information regarding the places.

## Navigation

* Click on any marker will open an information window that display some information about the location.
* Close the information window by clicking the X in the right corner.
* Click on an item on the provided list and the appropriate marker will display its information window.
* Type in the input field and filter the places alphabetically.

If you are on a mobile or tablet screen, the list is automatically hidden, and you can open it by clicking on the round button (and close it from the same button).

## Getting Started
